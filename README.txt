*SecureShare*

SecureShare will implement the 2-click-solution from heise.de ( http://www.heise.de/ct/artikel/2-Klicks-fuer-mehr-Datenschutz-1333879.html )
for more security into your Drupal. After installing SecureShare the buttons for Facebook, Google+ and Twitter will be only active after a second click from the user.
There will be no data send to Facebook, Google+ or Twitter before the button is clicked.

More description coming soon...

Installation:
--------------
Download the SecureShare-JS from https://github.com/Helrunar/secureshare-js and copying it to /sites/all/libraries/secureshare.
We have to do this, because the original Javascript is developed under the MIT-license, which ist not
compatible with the GPL
